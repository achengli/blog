  <p style="text-align: center;"> 
  Hello there, I am Yassin, a telecommunication engineer, mathematical enthusiast 
  and philosopher, and much more things.

  <br>
  <br>
  I am so curious with science, environment and knowledge in general, so I decided
  to create this blog to post things I see that could be useful and motivating for
  others.

  <br>
  <br>
  As you can see, this blog has topics but the disposition could not be the same in
  the future. I mean that possibly I will create more topics related to new passions
  and things I guess must have it's own place.

  I did this blog using <a href="https://gohugo.io/"><span>Hugo</span></a> static site
  generator. <b>Hugo</b> is so useful for minimalist people like me because you don't 
  have to acomplish so much in the style and web structure getting deep into css, html
  and javascript aspects. You can post directly your markdown files and even using 
  <b><i>LaTeX</i></b> sections.

  repository that is open. Be free to copy the code and edit what you want and take
  inspiration if it could be for it.

  The website is located in 
  <a href="https://github.com/achengli/blog.git">achengli/blog.git<span></span></a>.
  The link is also available in the left side menu in
