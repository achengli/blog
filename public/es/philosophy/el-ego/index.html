  The &ldquo;Self&rdquo; and the Ego
  #



  Who is the &ldquo;self&rdquo;?
  #


Historically, the question of who we are has been of great importance and is something we ask ourselves in order to have a starting point to reconstruct our understanding of reality.
One might think that the self is everything related to what lies within our inherent material being, meaning our physical and organic body. It’s a material definition grounded in what we believe ourselves to be, but without going beyond the biological. Alternatively, the &ldquo;self&rdquo; can also be understood as everything related to our actions—what we do and what forms part of our behavior.">

Alternatively, the &ldquo;self&rdquo; can also be understood as everything related to our actions—what we do and what forms part of our behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s define the self as what is part of us—not only what is physical, but also what drives us toward that. The conduct of action can be understood as the relationships we have with our environment and with ourselves. Now the <em>&ldquo;self&rdquo;</em> is more than just our material being; it is also what we write, what we desire, and the disposition of our memories reflected in <em><strong>actions and passions</strong></em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I differentiate between two types of ego: the <em>&ldquo;self-ego&rdquo;</em> and the ego. Let’s say that the self-ego is the ego that one internalizes by oneself—a way of personifying oneself as a better being than one may truly be, but with that internalized in one’s personal &ldquo;self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ego, on the other hand, is the one that reflects itself in relation to others. If we stop to think, the ego is what really harms our social well-being. Through the ego, we cause others to feel rejection and repulsion due to an elitist attitude. It might not seem like it, but this is deeply ingrained in our being.</p>
<p>Destroying our ego allows us to gain a new perspective on our &ldquo;self&rdquo; and the &ldquo;id&rdquo; that helps us calibrate who we are and what we have. I believe this is the starting point for building a philosophy and, in a way, accepting our conclusion about existence.</p>
<p>Now I also want to talk about the self-ego; this one is more closely tied to our own personification of who we are. Our inner self contains a self-generated image of ourselves that, as you might guess, is not identical to our actual self. It’s like the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonini%27s_paradox">real map paradox</a>. We can understand that our way of comprehending the people we know consists of creating a model of the person we relate to—a model that is not exact, but serves within an idealized framework.</p>
<p>Just as we do with others, we must get to know ourselves by creating that same model. The map of our &ldquo;self&rdquo; is the image of who we are—but without being us—and within it are rooted egos and beliefs that are false.</p>

<p>The lowest point of ego is to be nothing; however, this is impossible—but we can get close. What I mean is that if we manage to reduce our ideals to nothing, we will be able to start from a minimal but solid base. From there, we can begin the reconstruction of what we are, and this is achieved through self-reflection or active meditation. We begin to ask ourselves fundamental questions that lead us to respond using our mental map of the &ldquo;self&rdquo; that we are, and in this way, our self is rebuilt in a believable and real way—without lies created by our fear of the truth.</p>
