  Numbers Exist
  #

This view of numbers came to me after analyzing it with a friend from the book club.
Numbers are as real as we want to define them as real was the first thought that came
to mind, but then I reasoned that perhaps not all numbers are possible. In our reality,
only 0 and 1 truly exist as understandable concepts; that is, 0 would represent absence,
and 1 existence.">

<p>This view of numbers came to me after analyzing it with a friend from the book club.
<em>Numbers are as real as we want to define them as real</em> was the first thought that came
to mind, but then I reasoned that perhaps not all numbers are possible. In our reality,
only 0 and 1 truly exist as understandable concepts; that is, 0 would represent absence,
and 1 existence.</p>

  0 and 1 as the Only Logical Pair
  <a class="anchor" href="#0-and-1-as-the-only-logical-pair">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If, as I said, only these two numbers exist, it is because there are no two identical
pairs in the world that are not the same thing. For example, if I have two atoms
(<em>let’s define them for now as the smallest unit of reality we’re going to consider</em>),
these two atoms, although of the same element, are not identical. After all, they are
two particles with different subparticles, and they exist in relation to each other
in the same moment.</p>
<p>Electrons are quantum subparticles; specifically, they are a type of elementary particle
that gives shape to matter. Without them, no state of matter as we know it would exist.
However, there is only one single electron in the universe, because it is not possible
to determine the state of two individual electrons at the same moment in time. And when
I say the same moment, I mean the same infinitesimal

  \(\Delta t\)
</span>
.
This is difficult to measure because, in a way, what do we define as
<span>
  \(\Delta t\)
</span>
? It would be the time in which quantum fluctuations
violate the conservation of energy — but let’s not digress into deep physics.</p>
<p>What does happen is that if we affirm the existence of 0 and 1, then we are defining
two numbers. Therefore, 2 also exists, and so does 3, and 4, and all the integers up
to infinity. This explanation also helps me justify that 0 is a natural number, since
there has always been an endless debate among mathematicians who argue whether 0 is
natural or not. I understand natural numbers as those that are comprehensible as part
of our empirical reality, the one we can perceive. In this case, our rational
understanding of reality also plays a role; since absence is part of our rational
understanding, it could also be defined as part of reality—as mere absence of what
exists. For if non-existence could not be understood, we wouldn’t naturally understand
existence either. That’s why I consider 0 to be part of the natural numbers.</p>

</h2>
<p>After the expansion of definitions from abstract algebra into many other fields of
knowledge, we’ve seen models that closely align with what we observe in reality.
Set theory, group theory, and everything related to this mathematical vision has brought
its study closer to fields like psychology, where we can observe how, with the advance
of new research, behaviorist theories become more relevant to how we understand human
mental relations and language use. I know this thanks to some excellent explanations
from my friend Dani, who studies psychology — a great behaviorist, by the way.</p>
<p>This not only happens in psychology but also in computing. From that, great theories
were developed around languages and syntax, which led to the creation of complex
programming languages. And what’s even more beautiful to me: functional programming —
the use of mathematics in its purest form to solve complex software problems in an
elegant way.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s it. The connection I see between what I’ve explained about psychology and
computer science is that now we focus more on <strong>functional relationships</strong> and not so
much on <strong>end-to-end</strong> processes.</p>
