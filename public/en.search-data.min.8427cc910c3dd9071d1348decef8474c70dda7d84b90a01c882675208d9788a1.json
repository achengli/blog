Numbers are as real as we want to define them as real was the first thought that came to mind, but then I reasoned that perhaps not all numbers are possible. In our reality, only 0 and 1 truly exist as understandable concepts; that is, 0 would represent absence, and 1 existence.\n0 and 1 as the Only Logical Pair # If, as I said, only these two numbers exist, it is because there are no two identical pairs in the world that are not the same thing. For example, if I have two atoms (let’s define them for now as the smallest unit of reality we’re going to consider), these two atoms, although of the same element, are not identical. After all, they are two particles with different subparticles, and they exist in relation to each other in the same moment.\nElectrons are quantum subparticles; specifically, they are a type of elementary particle that gives shape to matter. Without them, no state of matter as we know it would exist. However, there is only one single electron in the universe, because it is not possible to determine the state of two individual electrons at the same moment in time. And when I say the same moment, I mean the same infinitesimal \\(\\Delta t\\) . This is difficult to measure because, in a way, what do we define as \\(\\Delta t\\) ? It would be the time in which quantum fluctuations violate the conservation of energy — but let’s not digress into deep physics.\nWhat does happen is that if we affirm the existence of 0 and 1, then we are defining two numbers. Therefore, 2 also exists, and so does 3, and 4, and all the integers up to infinity. This explanation also helps me justify that 0 is a natural number, since there has always been an endless debate among mathematicians who argue whether 0 is natural or not. I understand natural numbers as those that are comprehensible as part of our empirical reality, the one we can perceive. In this case, our rational understanding of reality also plays a role; since absence is part of our rational understanding, it could also be defined as part of reality—as mere absence of what exists. For if non-existence could not be understood, we wouldn’t naturally understand existence either. That’s why I consider 0 to be part of the natural numbers.\nOther Aspects of Mathematics and Reality # After the expansion of definitions from abstract algebra into many other fields of knowledge, we’ve seen models that closely align with what we observe in reality. Set theory, group theory, and everything related to this mathematical vision has brought its study closer to fields like psychology, where we can observe how, with the advance of new research, behaviorist theories become more relevant to how we understand human mental relations and language use. I know this thanks to some excellent explanations from my friend Dani, who studies psychology — a great behaviorist, by the way.\nThis not only happens in psychology but also in computing. From that, great theories were developed around languages and syntax, which led to the creation of complex programming languages. And what’s even more beautiful to me: functional programming — the use of mathematics in its purest form to solve complex software problems in an elegant way.\nMaybe that’s it. The connection I see between what I’ve explained about psychology and computer science is that now we focus more on functional relationships and not so much on end-to-end processes.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/maths/braket/","title":"Dirac Notation and Its Application in Quantum Mechanics","section":"Mathematics","content":" Dirac Notation and Its Application in Quantum Mechanics # Dirac Notation # Dirac devised a simplified way to express N-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\nThis notation is also known as bra-ket notation, and I’ll explain a bit about how it’s applied to quantum mechanics.\nAbout Bra-Kets # A Hilbert space is a probability space applied to a dimensional space.\nLet’s define a Hilbert space as the position probability equation of a particle\n\u0026ldquo;mathematically seen as a singularity or point\u0026rdquo; \\( \\Psi(\\vec{x}) \\)\nA bra-ket is an expression from the so-called Dirac notation. It is used in quantum mechanics\nto simplify integrals of the form:\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi (\\vec{x}) \\Phi^{*}(\\vec{x})\\,d\\vec{x} \\] This expression is simplified as:\n\\[ \\langle \\psi \\vert \\Phi \\rangle = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty} \\psi (\\vec{x}) \\Phi^{*}(\\vec{x})\\,d\\vec{x} \\] The bra \\( \\langle\\psi \\vert \\) is the expected value function,\nwhich is the probability density function, the wave function, and the applied function,\n\\( f(x) = 1 \\). In quantum mechanics, the wave function represents the probability of a particle being in a given position.\nThe ket \\( \\vert\\Phi\\rangle \\) is something similar, except that in this case\nit is the complex conjugate of the bra. Later, in the discrete case, it will be seen as a column vector\ninstead of a row vector.\nDiscrete Brakets # For application in quantum mechanics, we adopt specific spins, which represent the positions\nthat will later be understood as elements of a vector.\nA bra is defined by the probability of a particle being in a position \\(\\vec{x_0}\\),\nwhich we will simplify to a single dimension in this case.\n\\[ \\langle\\Psi(x_0)\\vert = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}\\Psi(\\vec{x_0})\\,d\\vec{x} = \\Psi(\\vec{x_0}) \\] In multiple dimensions, the bra as a discrete vector in Hilbert space looks like:\n\\[ \\langle\\Psi\\vert = \\{\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots , \\alpha_n\\} \\] The ket is the complex conjugate of the bra and is expressed as a column vector:\n\\[ \\vert\\Psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_1^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_2^{*} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_n^{*} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] The result of multiplying both as vectors gives a numeric value that represents\nthe probability of the event \\(\\sigma\\).\n\\[ \\langle\\Psi\\vert\\Psi\\rangle = \\{a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_1^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_2^{*} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_n^{*} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\sigma \\] Operations and Properties # Brakets are operated on vectorially, and we need to take into account certain\ninherent notation peculiarities, such as the vector product of a ket and a bra,\nknown as the tensor product. The result is a vector of dimension \\(n\\times m\\), where n is the dimension of the ket,\nand m is the dimension of the bra.\nThe result is a new Hilbert space, which now has more combinations due to quantum entanglement.\nThis leads to a wide range of new possible spaces when combining quantum states,\nand with it, a new way of doing computation.\nNow we encounter operators, which are essentially matrices that project the vector from the Hilbert space\nonto the same or a different Hilbert space.\nAmong the existing operators, we are particularly interested in those that are Hermitian,\nmeaning that when applied to a ket, they return the same ket multiplied by a real scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n$$ H\\vert\\Psi\\rangle = \\lambda\\vert\\Psi\\rangle $$\nAn example is the operator \\(H = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\),\nwhich, when applied to the ket \\(\\vert x\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\),\nresults in \\(\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\), which is \\(\\lambda\\vert x\\rangle\\) with \\(\\lambda = 1\\)\nin progress \u0026hellip; # "}]
