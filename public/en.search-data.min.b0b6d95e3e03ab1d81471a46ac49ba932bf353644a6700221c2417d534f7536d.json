Numbers are as real as we want to define them as real was the first thought that came to mind, but then I reasoned that perhaps not all numbers are possible. In our reality, only 0 and 1 truly exist as understandable concepts; that is, 0 would represent absence, and 1 existence.\n0 and 1 as the Only Logical Pair # If, as I said, only these two numbers exist, it is because there are no two identical pairs in the world that are not the same thing. For example, if I have two atoms (let’s define them for now as the smallest unit of reality we’re going to consider), these two atoms, although of the same element, are not identical. After all, they are two particles with different subparticles, and they exist in relation to each other in the same moment.\nElectrons are quantum subparticles; specifically, they are a type of elementary particle that gives shape to matter. Without them, no state of matter as we know it would exist. However, there is only one single electron in the universe, because it is not possible to determine the state of two individual electrons at the same moment in time. And when I say the same moment, I mean the same infinitesimal \\(\\Delta t\\) . This is difficult to measure because, in a way, what do we define as \\(\\Delta t\\) ? It would be the time in which quantum fluctuations violate the conservation of energy — but let’s not digress into deep physics.\nWhat does happen is that if we affirm the existence of 0 and 1, then we are defining two numbers. Therefore, 2 also exists, and so does 3, and 4, and all the integers up to infinity. This explanation also helps me justify that 0 is a natural number, since there has always been an endless debate among mathematicians who argue whether 0 is natural or not. I understand natural numbers as those that are comprehensible as part of our empirical reality, the one we can perceive. In this case, our rational understanding of reality also plays a role; since absence is part of our rational understanding, it could also be defined as part of reality—as mere absence of what exists. For if non-existence could not be understood, we wouldn’t naturally understand existence either. That’s why I consider 0 to be part of the natural numbers.\nOther Aspects of Mathematics and Reality # After the expansion of definitions from abstract algebra into many other fields of knowledge, we’ve seen models that closely align with what we observe in reality. Set theory, group theory, and everything related to this mathematical vision has brought its study closer to fields like psychology, where we can observe how, with the advance of new research, behaviorist theories become more relevant to how we understand human mental relations and language use. I know this thanks to some excellent explanations from my friend Dani, who studies psychology — a great behaviorist, by the way.\nThis not only happens in psychology but also in computing. From that, great theories were developed around languages and syntax, which led to the creation of complex programming languages. And what’s even more beautiful to me: functional programming — the use of mathematics in its purest form to solve complex software problems in an elegant way.\nMaybe that’s it. The connection I see between what I’ve explained about psychology and computer science is that now we focus more on functional relationships and not so much on end-to-end processes.\n"}]
