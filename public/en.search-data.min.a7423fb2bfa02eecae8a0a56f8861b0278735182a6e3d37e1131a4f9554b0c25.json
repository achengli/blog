Numbers are as real as we want to define them as real was the first thought that came to mind, but then I reasoned that perhaps not all numbers are possible. In our reality, only 0 and 1 truly exist as understandable concepts; that is, 0 would represent absence, and 1 existence.\n0 and 1 as the Only Logical Pair # If, as I said, only these two numbers exist, it is because there are no two identical pairs in the world that are not the same thing. For example, if I have two atoms (let’s define them for now as the smallest unit of reality we’re going to consider), these two atoms, although of the same element, are not identical. After all, they are two particles with different subparticles, and they exist in relation to each other in the same moment.\nElectrons are quantum subparticles; specifically, they are a type of elementary particle that gives shape to matter. Without them, no state of matter as we know it would exist. However, there is only one single electron in the universe, because it is not possible to determine the state of two individual electrons at the same moment in time. And when I say the same moment, I mean the same infinitesimal \\(\\Delta t\\) . This is difficult to measure because, in a way, what do we define as \\(\\Delta t\\) ? It would be the time in which quantum fluctuations violate the conservation of energy — but let’s not digress into deep physics.\nWhat does happen is that if we affirm the existence of 0 and 1, then we are defining two numbers. Therefore, 2 also exists, and so does 3, and 4, and all the integers up to infinity. This explanation also helps me justify that 0 is a natural number, since there has always been an endless debate among mathematicians who argue whether 0 is natural or not. I understand natural numbers as those that are comprehensible as part of our empirical reality, the one we can perceive. In this case, our rational understanding of reality also plays a role; since absence is part of our rational understanding, it could also be defined as part of reality—as mere absence of what exists. For if non-existence could not be understood, we wouldn’t naturally understand existence either. That’s why I consider 0 to be part of the natural numbers.\nOther Aspects of Mathematics and Reality # After the expansion of definitions from abstract algebra into many other fields of knowledge, we’ve seen models that closely align with what we observe in reality. Set theory, group theory, and everything related to this mathematical vision has brought its study closer to fields like psychology, where we can observe how, with the advance of new research, behaviorist theories become more relevant to how we understand human mental relations and language use. I know this thanks to some excellent explanations from my friend Dani, who studies psychology — a great behaviorist, by the way.\nThis not only happens in psychology but also in computing. From that, great theories were developed around languages and syntax, which led to the creation of complex programming languages. And what’s even more beautiful to me: functional programming — the use of mathematics in its purest form to solve complex software problems in an elegant way.\nMaybe that’s it. The connection I see between what I’ve explained about psychology and computer science is that now we focus more on functional relationships and not so much on end-to-end processes.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/maths/braket/","title":"Dirac Notation and Its Application in Quantum Mechanics","section":"Mathematics","content":" Dirac Notation and Its Application in Quantum Mechanics # Dirac Notation # Dirac devised a simplified way to express N-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\nThis notation is also known as bra-ket notation, and I’ll explain a bit about how it’s applied to quantum mechanics.\nAbout Bra-Kets # A Hilbert space is a probability space applied to a dimensional space.\nLet’s define a Hilbert space as the position probability equation of a particle\n\u0026ldquo;mathematically seen as a singularity or point\u0026rdquo; \\( \\Psi(\\vec{x}) \\)\nA bra-ket is an expression from the so-called Dirac notation. It is used in quantum mechanics\nto simplify integrals of the form:\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi (\\vec{x}) \\Phi^{*}(\\vec{x})\\,d\\vec{x} \\] This expression is simplified as:\n\\[ \\langle \\psi \\vert \\Phi \\rangle = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty} \\psi (\\vec{x}) \\Phi^{*}(\\vec{x})\\,d\\vec{x} \\] The bra \\( \\langle\\psi \\vert \\) is the expected value function,\nwhich is the probability density function, the wave function, and the applied function,\n\\( f(x) = 1 \\). In quantum mechanics, the wave function represents the probability of a particle being in a given position.\nThe ket \\( \\vert\\Phi\\rangle \\) is something similar, except that in this case\nit is the complex conjugate of the bra. Later, in the discrete case, it will be seen as a column vector\ninstead of a row vector.\nDiscrete Brakets # For application in quantum mechanics, we adopt specific spins, which represent the positions\nthat will later be understood as elements of a vector.\nA bra is defined by the probability of a particle being in a position \\(\\vec{x_0}\\),\nwhich we will simplify to a single dimension in this case.\n\\[ \\langle\\Psi(x_0)\\vert = \\int^{\\infty}_{-\\infty}\\Psi(\\vec{x_0})\\,d\\vec{x} = \\Psi(\\vec{x_0}) \\] In multiple dimensions, the bra as a discrete vector in Hilbert space looks like:\n\\[ \\langle\\Psi\\vert = \\{\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots , \\alpha_n\\} \\] The ket is the complex conjugate of the bra and is expressed as a column vector:\n\\[ \\vert\\Psi\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_1^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_2^{*} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_n^{*} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\] The result of multiplying both as vectors gives a numeric value that represents\nthe probability of the event \\(\\sigma\\).\n\\[ \\langle\\Psi\\vert\\Psi\\rangle = \\{a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha_0^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_1^{*} \\\\ \\alpha_2^{*} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\alpha_n^{*} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} = \\sigma \\] Operations and Properties # Brakets are operated on vectorially, and we need to take into account certain\ninherent notation peculiarities, such as the vector product of a ket and a bra,\nknown as the tensor product. The result is a vector of dimension \\(n\\times m\\), where n is the dimension of the ket,\nand m is the dimension of the bra.\nThe result is a new Hilbert space, which now has more combinations due to quantum entanglement.\nThis leads to a wide range of new possible spaces when combining quantum states,\nand with it, a new way of doing computation.\nNow we encounter operators, which are essentially matrices that project the vector from the Hilbert space\nonto the same or a different Hilbert space.\nAmong the existing operators, we are particularly interested in those that are Hermitian,\nmeaning that when applied to a ket, they return the same ket multiplied by a real scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n$$ H\\vert\\Psi\\rangle = \\lambda\\vert\\Psi\\rangle $$\nAn example is the operator \\(H = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; -1 \\end{bmatrix} \\),\nwhich, when applied to the ket \\(\\vert x\\rangle = \\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\),\nresults in \\(\\begin{bmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\\), which is \\(\\lambda\\vert x\\rangle\\) with \\(\\lambda = 1\\)\nin progress \u0026hellip; # "},{"id":2,"href":"/philosophy/el-ego/","title":"The \"Self\" and the Ego","section":"Philosophy","content":" The \u0026ldquo;Self\u0026rdquo; and the Ego # Who is the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo;? # Historically, the question of who we are has been of great importance and is something we ask ourselves in order to have a starting point to reconstruct our understanding of reality.\nOne might think that the self is everything related to what lies within our inherent material being, meaning our physical and organic body. It’s a material definition grounded in what we believe ourselves to be, but without going beyond the biological. Alternatively, the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; can also be understood as everything related to our actions—what we do and what forms part of our behavior.\nLet’s define the self as what is part of us—not only what is physical, but also what drives us toward that. The conduct of action can be understood as the relationships we have with our environment and with ourselves. Now the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; is more than just our material being; it is also what we write, what we desire, and the disposition of our memories reflected in actions and passions1\nThe self-ego # I differentiate between two types of ego: the \u0026ldquo;self-ego\u0026rdquo; and the ego. Let’s say that the self-ego is the ego that one internalizes by oneself—a way of personifying oneself as a better being than one may truly be, but with that internalized in one’s personal \u0026ldquo;self.\u0026rdquo;\nThe ego, on the other hand, is the one that reflects itself in relation to others. If we stop to think, the ego is what really harms our social well-being. Through the ego, we cause others to feel rejection and repulsion due to an elitist attitude. It might not seem like it, but this is deeply ingrained in our being.\nDestroying our ego allows us to gain a new perspective on our \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; that helps us calibrate who we are and what we have. I believe this is the starting point for building a philosophy and, in a way, accepting our conclusion about existence.\nNow I also want to talk about the self-ego; this one is more closely tied to our own personification of who we are. Our inner self contains a self-generated image of ourselves that, as you might guess, is not identical to our actual self. It’s like the real map paradox. We can understand that our way of comprehending the people we know consists of creating a model of the person we relate to—a model that is not exact, but serves within an idealized framework.\nJust as we do with others, we must get to know ourselves by creating that same model. The map of our \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; is the image of who we are—but without being us—and within it are rooted egos and beliefs that are false.\nHow to avoid the self-ego and the ego # The lowest point of ego is to be nothing; however, this is impossible—but we can get close. What I mean is that if we manage to reduce our ideals to nothing, we will be able to start from a minimal but solid base. From there, we can begin the reconstruction of what we are, and this is achieved through self-reflection or active meditation. We begin to ask ourselves fundamental questions that lead us to respond using our mental map of the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; that we are, and in this way, our self is rebuilt in a believable and real way—without lies created by our fear of the truth.\nActions and passions as defined by Spinoza’s ethics.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"}]
